Develstatus:
	- Possibility to ban prefixes and ip-ranges. (suggestion maksalaatikko)
	- Fix the crash if the clock is set back...
	- add nick checking for insane chars as spaces  ( $|<>:?*"/\)
	- split up proto_nmdc_state_online
	- seperate kick redirect address
	- event handler.
		- add events for user creation and deletion. (Why??)
	- add anti-flooder module (not for 0.1)
	- SSL (not for 0.1)
	- ADC (future)
	- !warn command
	- redo tag parsing, make it more flexible. (allow missing fields).
	- md5 password hashing. preferably verlihub compatible.
	- !topic
	- add a hideuser right?
	- redirection plugin

Large changes:
	- rebuild proto_nmdc_flush_cache()
		use generic cache elements of 1->N, 1->(N-1) and 1->1 nature.
	- split off timers in esocket.c, export them genericly
	- consider adding the chunked approach FarCry suggested for the nicklistcache
	- command line parameters.
		- config dir

Plugins:
	- nick rules: unwanted/required nick prefixes
	- passive user module.

Ideas:
	- if i ever implement something of a congestion measure, i could add
		cache_rebuild  to the "when i got time" list
