Develstatus:
	- event handler.
		- add events for user creation and deletion. (Why??)
	- add anti-flooder module (not for 0.1)
	- SSL (not for 0.1)
	- ADC (future)
	- hublist support
	- !drop command.
	- redo tag parsing, make it more flexible. (allow missing fields.

Large changes:
	- rebuild proto_nmdc_flush_cache()
		use generic cache elements of 1->N, 1->(N-1) and 1->1 nature.
	- move all token parsing to nmdc_token.c
	- split off timers in esocket.c, export them genericly
	- add poll() to esocket to replace epoll if epoll unavailable.
	- consider adding the chunked approach FarCry suggested for the nicklistcache

Ideas:
	- if i ever implement something of a congestion measure, i could add
		cache_rebuild  to the "when i got time" list
